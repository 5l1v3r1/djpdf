# Scans to PDF

This program creates small, searchable PDFs from scanned documents.
It divides images into bitonal foreground images (text) and a color
background image, then compresses them separately.
An invisible OCR text layer is added, making the PDF searchable.

Color and grayscale scans need some preparation for good results.
Recommended tools are ScanTailor or GIMP.

A GUI and command line interface are included.
